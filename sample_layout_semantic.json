Study Objectives: Primary: To assess the safety of unilateral intravitreal administration of OCU200 in subjects with center-involved DME. Secondary: To assess the anti-OCU200 antibody formation and pharmacokinetics of OCU200. Exploratory: To assess the following: · The effect of OCU200 on central subfield thickness (CST), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) · Dose response of OCU200 · The need for rescue intervention due to worsening of DME in the treated eye Study Design and Methodology: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study with 4 cohorts in the dose-escalation portion of the study. An accelerated 3+3 design with sequential dosing will be used. Under the escalation design, there will be 12 subjects enrolled if there are no DLTs and up to 24 subjects under the condition that exactly 1 of the 3 subjects of every cohort is determined to have a DLT. A total of up to 24 subjects will be included in this study. The following algorithm will be followed for dose-escalation: OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 4 of 81",

The DSMB will review the safety data of the sentinel subject in cohort 4 as per the charter prior to proceeding with further cohort 4 dosing. Cohort 4 (5 mg/mL): 3+3 subjects will receive intravitreal injection of up to 50 uL OCU200 Cohort 4 dose concentration. Rationale: To further refine the therapeutic window and explore potential improvements in efficacy while preserving an acceptable safety profile, a new intermediate dose level of 0.25 mg/eye (5 mg/mL) is proposed for evaluation as Cohort 4. This dose level is informed by nonclinical toxicology data from non-human primate (NHP) studies, in which the highest tested and well-tolerated dose was 0.5 mg/eye. No ocular toxicity was observed at 0.5 mg/eye (10 mg/mL) except for minimal microscopic observations in NHP study and therefore 0.5 mg/eye (10mg/mL) is considered no observed adverse event level (NOAEL) for ocular tissues. The proposed dose (0.25 mg/eye) in cohort 4 will have 2X safety margin based on NOAEL. Inclusion of the 0.25 mg/eye dose in the clinical trial design will enable a more detailed characterization of the dose-response relationship, supporting identification of an optimal dose that balances safety with therapeutic effect before proceeding to the maximum tolerated dose. The sentinel subject will receive 1 intravitreal injection of OCU200 on Day 1. One-week post- dose, safety data will be reviewed by DSMB prior to proceeding with dosing. If the sentinel subject does not have a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as determined by the DSMB, two additional subjects will be dosed on cohort 4 dose concentration. All subjects will subsequently receive a 2nd dose (6 weeks later) according to their assigned cohort. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 1 week of safety data post-dosing (subject 1 will receive second dose, subject 2 and subject 3 will receive 1st dose) of all 3 subjects in cohort 4.",

This process will be followed for Cohorts 2, 3, and 4. Sample Size Justification: The trial will enroll up to 24 subjects. The sample size was estimated based on the minimum number necessary to obtain a preliminary clinical assessment regarding OCU200's safety profile. Number of Subjects (planned): Total planned subjects will be up to 24. Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for study participation. Note: · Eligibility for subjects will be determined by the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. · Subject inclusion will be determined by Sponsor upon reviewing subjects screening packet, PI recommendations and in consultation with scientific advisory board (SAB).

      "text": "4. INTRODUCTION 4.1. Disease Background According to WHO, 422 million individuals currently have diabetes [1], and this number is projected to increase to 578 million by 2030[2]. Diabetes describes a group of metabolic disorders characterized by increased blood glucose concentration [3] that leads to macrovascular complications, including coronary heart disease and stroke, and microvascular complications, such as renal disease and diabetic retinopathy (DR) [4]. DR affects approximately one-third of adults with diabetes and is the leading cause of acquired vison loss in the working adult population [3, 5], specifically 77% of type 1 diabetics and 25% of type 2 diabetics [6]. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of visual disability throughout the world in subjects with DR. With the increasing global incidence of diabetes in both developed and developing countries, the prevalence of DR and DME have likewise increased. The current worldwide estimate of diabetic individuals with any form of DR is 92.6 million, including 20.6 million with DME [7]. The chronic hyperglycemic state in subjects with uncontrolled diabetes results in the development of DR, which can eventually lead to DME, a chronic multifactorial condition in which the blood-retina barrier (BRB) breaks down due to loss of pericytes, thickening of the basement membrane, and loss of tight junctions of the retinal endothelium from chronic hyperglycemia [4]. The breakdown of the BRB allows leakage and accumulation of fluid and macromolecules, such as lipoproteins, in the retina and reduced vision [8]. 4.2. Clinical Needs Laser photocoagulation has been the standard of care for DME. However, the procedure is not harmless and can cause scars and scotomas and does not reverse vision loss [9]. The emergence of new therapies for DME changed the treatment paradigm. VEGF and inflammation play a vital role in initiation and propagation of edema and exudation through the course of DME. Currently, two major classes of molecules are used to treat DME: Anti-VEGF and anti-inflammation (corticosteroids). Anti-VEGF therapy is first-line therapy. FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies for DME are Eylea® (aflibercept, Regeneron), Lucentis® (ranibizumab, Genentech), and Vabysmo® (faricimab-svoa, Genentech). In addition, Avastin® (bevacizumab), is often used off-label for DME treatment. It has been shown that approximately 50% of DME subjects have persistent DME after 1 year of anti-VEGF treatment [10]. Some subjects resistant to anti-VEGF may respond to steroids [7]. Ozurdex® (dexamethasone implant, Allergan) and Iluvien® (fluocinolone ophthalmic implant, Alimera Sciences) are FDA- approved corticosteroids implants for DME. However, they present a risk for adverse effects, particularly cataract formation and elevated IOP [7]. 4.3. Therapeutic Rationale Approved therapies for DME target only one pathway associated with DR and DME, either angiogenesis with anti-VEGF activity or inflammation in the case of steroid therapy, but the complex nature of the disease and role of various pathways limits the effectiveness of current therapies. There are many subjects who show a sub-optimal response, remain non-responder or OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 81",

Ocugen, Inc., has developed a novel therapy for DME, i.e., OCU200 that has anti-VEGF, anti- inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. OCU200 is a novel fusion protein that targets multiple pathways associated with DME and helps in efficient targeted delivery of drug to diseased tissue. In pre-clinical studies, the effects of OCU200 were explored in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) rat model (a model of neovascularization), as well as oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model of retinal degeneration (one of the most common model systems for neovascular diseases, such as DR). In the CNV rat model study, animals received PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline), bevacizumab, or OCU200 at a dose of 166 uM by intravitreal injection. A second group of animals was treated with 1-500 uM OCU200 after 14 day CNV induction period for a dose response evaluation. OCU200 was found to be 1.4- and 1.8-fold more efficacious in reducing CNV lesion area compared to bevacizumab or tumstatin, respectively (Figure 1A), and the dose response portion of the study showed that OCU200 had significant CNV reduction at 100 uM doses and above (Figure 1B). In the OIR mouse study, neovascularization was induced in neonatal C57B1/6J mice, and animals were divided into treatment groups including normoxic, vehicle, one of three different doses of OCU200 (2.5, 5, or 10 µg/eye), and aflibercept (Eylea®, 20 µg/eye), and treatments were administered intravitreally. Avascular area (AVA) and neovascularization (NV) were quantified in each group and a significant reduction in both AVA and NV was observed in all treatment groups compared to untreated contralateral eyes (Figure 2). Further, a significant decrease in NV and AVA was observed at the low (2.5 µg/eye) and high (10 µg/eye) dose groups compared to vehicle treatment alone (Figure 3).

At the end of 14 days after laser induced burns, the rats were intravitreally treated with PBS pH 7.4, bevacizumab, tumstatin, or OCU200 (Tf-T). Rats were euthanized, and eyes were enucleated at the end of the 14 days of treatment. A. A quantitative comparison of the treatments indicated superior efficacy of OCU200 as compared to bevacizumab and tumstatin. N=6; P < 0.05; * indicates comparison to PBS and/or tumstatin; + indicates comparison to bevacizumab B. Dose response curve using OCU200 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 nM.

OCU200 OCU200 is a novel recombinant fusion protein consisting of a full-length human transferrin and human tumstatin derived from type IV collagen and attached through a linker (Figure 4). Transferrin targets tumstatin to the choroid and retina, where it binds to transferrin receptors expressed at the surface of the endothelial cells. Tumstatin acts as an anti-VEGF, anti- inflammatory, and anti-oxidative agent by binding to the integrin receptors (i.e., alphaV beta 3 (avß3) integrin and alpha3 beta 1 (a3ß1) integrin). OCU200 selectively inhibits the proliferation of active endothelial tissue that expresses high levels of avß3 integrin receptor. It disrupts choroidal and retinal neovascularization without disturbing non-angiogenic vasculature and OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 81",

Tumstatin binding to avß3 and a3ß1 integrin receptors initiates a cascade of pathways that decrease endothelial cell protein synthesis and proliferation, inhibition of VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Tumstatin's anti-oxidative properties reduce inflammation. Moreover, the transferrin component of OCU200 can potentially act as a sink for intracellular free iron [11] that can potentially catalyze reactive oxygen species generation and induce oxidative stress. Hence, in presence of transferrin, the oxidative stress in the vicinity of ocular tissue would be drastically decreased which adds to the therapeutic potential of OCU200. Altogether, OCU200 properties make it a potential therapeutic option for DME subjects, including those who do not respond to currently approved therapies.",

In summary, our pre-clinical studies demonstrated efficacy of OCU200 in targeting multiple pathways associated with DME to prevent disease manifestation and progression. 4.5.2. Clinical OCU200 has not been previously administered to human subjects and clinical data are not available. The trial described herein represents the first-in-human (FIH) administration of OCU200. Investigators must use the safety data obtained in the nonclinical evaluation of OCU200 as the basis for informing the subject risk/benefit balance when selecting subjects for study participation. The IB should be read and understood in its entirety. 4.6. Clinical Rationale 4.6.1. Rationale for Study Design The study is designed to evaluate the safety of multiple ascending dose levels of OCU200 in a parallel and stepwise manner in a small number of subjects. Ongoing evaluation of emergent safety data will be conducted by DSMB. The design includes discrete study periods that allow subjects' screening, treatment, follow ups, and measurements of outcomes. Multiple factors are incorporated into the study design to safeguard and monitor the rights and safety of subjects and are described herein. To maximize subject protection, the study will be conducted by Investigators at clinical sites with expertise in diabetic retinopathy.

Criteria are established for dose adjustments and for cohort and study stopping. Adjustments to target doses and the number of subjects per cohort may be recommended based on review of the data. The assessments and measurements in the trial assess both general systemic safety and ocular safety. Baseline is established for subjects and intensive monitoring of subject safety in the days and weeks following dose administrations is incorporated. 4.6.2. Rationale for Dose, Regimen, and Duration of Treatment OCU200 has been evaluated in a nonclinical program to demonstrate proof of concept (POC) in multiple rodent (rat and mouse) models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Rodent models of CNV and OIR are excellent model for DME. In addition, safety and immunogenicity of OCU200 dose were evaluated in rabbit and nonhuman primates. The results of these evaluations support the OCU200 clinical design for Phase 1 study in humans. Selection of the starting dose: Three dose-levels will be sequentially tested. The starting dose is selected based on preclinical animal experiments, including preclinical efficacy studies in rodents and toxicology studies in non-human primates. Injection volume is selected up to 50 uL. The injected volume in clinical practice for current anti-VEGFs ranges from 25 to 100 uL. This volume is ~1-2% of the total vitreous volume (~5 mL). The volume expansion associated with the injection may cause immediate rise in IOP. However, it typically resolves spontaneously as the sclera expand to accommodate the change in volume [12]. Dose Schedule: To reduce possible unexpected risks for the initial exposure in humans, the following staggering strategies are employed in this study: 1. One subject in each cohort (sentinel subject) will be dosed in advance of the full cohort. c) Following evaluation of safety in the sentinel subject at one week post-dosing, administration to the remaining subjects in the same cohort will proceed. d) One-week post dosing safety data of all 3 subjects in each cohort will be evaluated by DSMB prior to proceeding to next cohort. A schematic of study design and cohort flow are presented as Figure 5 and Figure 6 in Section 6.1, respectively. OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 81",

Duration of Treatment: OCU200 will be administered to each subject in the unilateral study eye a total of 2 times (6 weeks apart). Subjects are considered to have completed this study if they complete the final EOS visit at Week 24. The study duration will be approximately 24 weeks for each subject. 4.6.3. Risks and Benefits 4.6.3.1. OCU200 Risks The results of toxicology studies and efficacy in multiple relevant animal models strongly support OCU200 as a potential treatment option for DME in humans. The study described herein is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OCU200 at multiple target doses. Since OCU200 has not been previously administered to humans, unidentified risks may not be known at this time. More detailed information about known and expected risks and reasonably expected adverse events of procedures may be found in the IB, which is the single reference safety document for this study. Some of the rare ocular and systemic risks associated with intravitreal injection of current anti-VEGF treatments in the market include anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal artery and venous occlusion, hemorrhagic macular infarction, development or exacerbation of ocular ischemic syndrome, sixth nerve palsy, visual hallucinations, erectile dysfunction, and acute decrease in kidney function [13]. It is important that the Investigator thoroughly read and understand the IB for OCU200 and use the data presented in the IB as the basis for risk assessment in subjects. If additional safety information becomes available during the trial, it will be provided to Investigators and subjects. 4.6.3.2. Intravitreal Injection Risks Risks associated with intravitreal injection include eye pain, burning sensation, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, ocular discomfort, conjunctival hemorrhage, floaters, retinal detachment, increased IOP, cataract formation, intraocular inflammation, and endophthalmitis [14]. 4.6.3.3. Other Procedural Risks Venipuncture to obtain blood samples may result in bruising, inflammation, and pain. New hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (not previously observed in the subject) may occur to ocular agents used during ocular examinations. If medical adhesives are used (bandages, ECG pads, etc.), mild skin irritations and redness may occur on skin exposed to these adhesives. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur to eye drops or anesthetic and antimicrobial drops used in ophthalmic procedures. Fatigue may be experienced when multiple ophthalmic assessments are completed during a study visit. Risks associated with fluorescein angiography include (but are not limited to) dizziness, nausea, increased heart rate, blurred vision, and urine color change. 4.6.3.4. COVID Risks Against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential risk of a subject developing COVID-19 has been considered in terms of the risk/benefit evaluation.

The following COVID-19 Risk Mitigation measures will be implemented: · The Sponsor will work with clinical sites to document site-level procedures regarding COVID-related precautions for subjects and staff. These precautions may include use of personal protective equipment such as face coverings, masks, and shields, and procedures such as temperature screening and social distancing and will be consistent with the policies of the institution and compliant with government guidelines. · The site visit schedule has been carefully reviewed to minimize unnecessary visits and minimize subject exposure. The schedule is not expected to increase subject risk beyond that encountered in the routine delivery of healthcare for subjects with chronic eye disease. · The Sponsor will continue to assess risk during the clinical study. This risk assessment will include overall study risk as well as regional risks to allow for adaptations that may be required at a local level depending on COVID-19 infection rates across US regions and cities. Risk mitigation measures, where applicable, will be amended based on emerging government guidelines. 4.6.3.5. Benefits This study is designed to evaluate the safety of multiple ascending doses of OCU200 in subjects with center-involved diabetic macular edema. Exploratory endpoints may provide preliminary information on the efficacy of treatment with OCU200; however, subjects may receive no benefit from participation in this study. Subjects may experience improvements in their visual acuity. Any such improvement may be transitory. Subjects may experience an altruistic sense of satisfaction by participating in this study knowing that information learned from this study may benefit others and aid in the advancement of therapeutic options for future subjects.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 6.1. Overall Study Design An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 5 and the flow of the OCU200 administration by cohorts is presented in Figure 6. This is a multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study with 4 cohorts in the dose-escalation portion of the study. An accelerated 3+3 design with sequential dosing. Under the escalation design, there will be 12 subjects enrolled if there are no DLTs and up to 24 subjects under the condition that exactly 1 of the 3 subjects of every cohort is determined to have a DLT. A total of up to 24 subjects will be included in this study. Each subject will receive a total of 2 intravitreal injections of OCU200 6 weeks apart. The study for an individual subject will consist of the following periods (Figure 5). · Screening up to 28 (+/-3)days · Treatment (Day of injection up to 8 (+/-2) days post-injection assessment) · Month 3 visit · Month 4 visit · Month 6 (End of Study) visit",

The DSMB will review the safety data of the sentinel subject in cohort 4 as per the charter prior to proceeding with further cohort 4 dosing. Cohort 4 (5 mg/mL): Rationale: To further refine the therapeutic window and explore potential improvements in efficacy while preserving an acceptable safety profile, a new intermediate dose level of 0.25 mg/eye (5 mg/mL) is proposed for evaluation as Cohort 4. This dose level is informed by nonclinical toxicology data from non-human primate (NHP) studies, in which the highest tested and well- tolerated dose was 0.5 mg/eye. This is half of the maximum tolerable dose tested in NHP. No ocular toxicity was observed at 0.5 mg/eye (10 mg/mL) except for minimal microscopic observations in NHP study and therefore 0.5 mg/eye (10mg/mL) is considered no observed adverse event level (NOAEL) for ocular tissues. The proposed dose (0.25 mg/eye) in cohort 4 will have 2X safety margin based on NOAEL. Inclusion of the 0.25 mg/eye dose in the clinical trial design will enable a more detailed characterization of the dose-response relationship, supporting identification of an optimal dose that balances safety with therapeutic effect before proceeding to the maximum tolerated dose. 3+3 subjects will receive intravitreal injection of up to 50 uL OCU200 dose concentration. The sentinel subject will receive 1 intravitreal injection of OCU200 on Day 1. One-week post- dose, safety data will be reviewed by DSMB prior to proceeding with dosing. If the sentinel subject does not have a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as determined by the DSMB, two additional subjects will be dosed on cohort 4 dose concentration. All subjects will subsequently receive a 2nd dose (6 weeks later) according to their assigned cohort The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 1 week of safety data post-dosing (subject 1 will receive second dose, subject 2 and subject 3 will receive 1st dose) of all 3 subjects in cohort 4.",

Treatment Assignment This is an open-label study, and all subjects will receive a total of two injections of OCU200 (6 weeks apart) at the target or adjusted dose level assigned to their respective cohort. 6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 6.4.1. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses This protocol allows for adjustment of targeted doses based upon emergent data from ongoing DSMB safety reviews. Common expected AE and SAE are known complications of intravitreal injection. Details of AE and SAE are described in the IB. The expected AEs include conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, foreign body sensation, ocular discomfort, floater, cataract formation, and increased intraocular pressure; expected SAEs include endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, retinal tear or detachment, decreased visual acuity, retinal vascular occlusion, and ocular hemorrhage. These AEs and SAEs are related to intravitreal injection. Potential systemic AEs include headache, fatigue, and hypertension. Systemic SAEs include thromboembolic events. Dose-limiting side effects are defined as OCU200-related AEs that are considered severe in nature, intolerable, or that, in the opinion of the Investigator, Sponsor, or DSMB would place subjects at medical risk if a higher dose of OCU200 were to be administered. These AEs would be consistent with Grade 3 and higher severity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) latest version [15]. The dose-limiting side effects of this study are as follows: Note: Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an OCU200 related event not resolving within 14 days (despite active treatment or management of the clinical condition). It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the causality. · Persistent or new onset of intraocular inflammation; uveitis or vitritis with more than 3+ (i.e. 4+) cells in anterior chamber, intermediate vitreous cells more than 3+ (i.e. 4+), or pan-uveitis, despite adequate treatment. The grading is based on Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN), where 3+ denotes 26-50 cells and 4+ denotes >50 cells per high-power field (1x1 mm slit beam). · Rare systemic OCU200-related coagulopathy including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), when no other possible causes can be discovered. · Sustained elevation of IOP to more than 30 mmHg OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 38 of 81",

Criteria for Study Termination The study may be terminated by the Sponsor at any time and for any reason after informing the Investigators. The DSMB may also recommend study termination. Study termination means the permanent stopping of administration of OCU200 to additional subjects, inclusive of subjects screened, subjects who received less than 2 doses, and subjects enrolled to whom OCU200 has not yet been administered. Termination does not mean suspension of scheduled safety monitoring procedures. If the study is terminated, the following instructions should be followed, unless the DSMB and/or the Study Medical Monitor advise otherwise: a) Subjects who have already received OCU200, irrespective of dose, will continue to maintain the protocol schedule of activities. Additional dosing will be paused for these subjects. b) Subjects who have already enrolled into the study but have not received OCU200 will wait for DSMB recommendation. The scheduled date for injection may be postponed or cancelled. The Investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject's safety, interest, and rights.

Subject Withdrawal Criteria Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 1. A subject is free to withdraw informed consent from the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment the subject may need to receive. a) Withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. b) Rescue Criteria: The investigator should monitor progression of the DME during the study and determine whether a subject should be withdrawn from the study to receive standard-of-care rescue therapy (due to worsening of the DME). The type of rescue therapy should be determined by the investigator, as per local clinical practice. The criteria for rescue therapy are BCVA decrease of 3 lines (15 letters) or more from baseline or CST worsening of >100 um from baseline. At the time of discontinuation from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted. All assessments outlined for early withdraw visit should be completed. In the event that a subject elects not to return to the clinic for the scheduled visit, the Investigator must make every effort to contact the subject to review all AEs. If a subject has an adverse event, the subject will be followed until the adverse event has either resolved or satisfactorily stabilized in the judgment of the Investigator. When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) and reported on the clinical trial SAE Report. Subjects who have been treated with OCU200 will be encouraged to remain in the study and complete all safety follow-up assessments. If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples, but data already generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may be used, to protect the integrity of existing analyses. The investigator must document any such requests in the site study records. OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 81",

Any subject to whom OCU200 has been administered and who is discontinued for an adverse event will not be replaced. A subject who is withdrawn from the study during the screening and baseline periods before administration of OCU200 may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor. Subjects who are withdrawn prior to study completion (due to worsening of DME and at investigator's discretion), will not be replaced. 7.3.1. Lost to Follow up Subjects will be considered lost to follow-up (LTFU) if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits without stating an intention to withdraw consent and they cannot be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: · The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible, counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. · Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts (e.g., dates of telephone calls and registered letters) should be documented in the subject's medical record. A subject should not be considered lost to follow up until these efforts have been made. · Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.

Safety will be assessed by medical review of adverse event (AE) reports, clinical laboratory findings, physical examinations, vital signs, ophthalmic examination, and anti-OCU200 antibody formation. Safety assessments are to be conducted according to the schedules provided in Table 3. Brief descriptions of each of the safety parameters are provided herein. 10.1.1. Demographic Demographic information including age, gender, ethnicity, and race will be obtained at the Screening visit. 10.1.2. Medical History A full medical history will be obtained at specific visits according to Table 3. The medical history should focus on any significant medical, ocular, or surgical history. All previous and concurrent treatments for DME should be recorded in the eCRF with an emphasis on the history of diabetes, and any associated ocular procedures and/or medications, including history of previous anti-VEGF or steroid injections. The ocular history will include diagnostic data if completed, and disease progression as documented through medical notes and results of ophthalmic exams, procedures, and assessments. 10.1.3. Vital Signs All vital sign measurements will be taken after a subject has been in a sitting position for a minimum of 5 minutes. Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature. Radial or brachial pulse will be measured over a 30 second interval, if performed manually and respiration rate will be measured over a 60 second interval. The body temperature may be oral or aural. Blood pressure should be obtained from the same arm throughout the study whenever possible. An electronic or manual sphygmomanometer or an electronic oscillometric device may be used. The method of assessment should be consistent throughout the study. 10.1.4. Weight and Height Height and weight will be measured in full indoor clothing without shoes. A body-mass index will be calculated using the screening height and weight values. 10.1.5. Physical Examination Physical examination assesses the general wellness of the subject. Report any acute distress, pain, or discomfort with focused system examination if the subject is symptomatic. The investigator determines if an emergency referral or referral to a specialist is needed. A full physical examination is required at the screening of subjects and prior to IP administration, including skin, ENT, head, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and extremities.

Laboratory Assessments A listing of laboratory tests utilized during the screening period to qualify subjects for study participation and throughout the study to monitor subject safety is provided in Table 5. All laboratory testing will be conducted in the fasting state and a CLIA certified laboratory will be used for all analyses. Blood and urine samples are to be obtained and processed according to instructions provided in the study Reference Manual. Investigators will review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and assess all values outside the reference ranges for clinical significance. The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRFs. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified. All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 5, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Assessments. If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution's local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator, then the results must be recorded in the eCRFs.

Both the visual acuity lane and examiner must have current certification and maintain certification throughout the study. To the extent possible, all ophthalmic examinations for a subject throughout the course of the study should be completed by the same examiner. BCVA assessment should be performed prior to all other ophthalmic assessments and pupil dilation at all visits. 10.1.9. Slit Lamp biomicroscopy A slit lamp exam will include examination and assessment of external structures, lids and lashes, conjunctiva and sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and pupil, lens, vitreous and fundus examination in both eyes. To the extent possible, all ophthalmic examinations for a subject throughout the course of the study should be completed by the same examiner. 10.1.10. Intraocular pressure IOP will be assessed at all study visits. IOP should be measured in a seated position and the method should be consistent throughout the study. IOP will be assessed at all visits and pre- and post- injection at visits with study drug administrations. Pre-injection IOP must be performed prior to dilation. To the extent possible, all ophthalmic examinations for a subject throughout the course of the study should be completed by the same examiner and the same method/instrument. 10.1.11. Indirect Ophthalmoscopy Following dilation, fundus will be examined with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression. The dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy should be conducted prior to study drug administration on applicable visits. To the extent possible, all ophthalmic examinations for a subject throughout the course of the study should be completed by the same examiner. 10.1.12. Color Fundus photography Color fundus photographs will be taken to evaluate retinal anatomy and grade diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS). Fundus photography should be conducted prior to study drug administration on applicable visits. To the extent possible, all ophthalmic examinations for a subject throughout the course of the study should be completed by the same examiner. 10.1.13. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) SD-OCT will be utilized to assess retinal thickness.

Adverse and Serious Adverse Events For more details please also see IB. 10.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 10.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) According to the ICH E2A2 guideline and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.323, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptoms, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition: · Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (ECG, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease). · Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of condition. · New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. · Sign, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/ self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. · Sign, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of suspected drug-drug interactions. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition: · Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). · Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record \"anemia\" rather than \"low hemoglobin\"). · AEs will be assessed during the study as described in the schedule of assessments and should be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRFs and reported to the sponsor, regardless of their relationship to study drug or clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported to the sponsor. · All AEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or within 5 years following the cessation of treatment, whether they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by Ocugen or designee. 10.2.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria: · Fatal: AE resulted in death · Life-threatening: The AEs placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This classification does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe. · Hospitalization: The AE resulted in hospitalization or prolonged an existing subject hospitalization. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or out subject setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalization\" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. · Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before the signing of informed consent in the study or routine check-ups are not SAEs OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 81",

If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as \"unrelated.\" If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the study treatment and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered \"related.\" If the relationship between the AE/SAE and OCU200 is determined to be \"possible\" or \"probable\", the event is considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. Since all study treatments (investigational product, study procedures, other study medications) are considered and assessed for relationship, a single AE may be found to be possibly or probably related to two or more study treatments (e.g., OCU200 and administration procedure). The Investigator's assessment of an AE's relationship to SD is part of the documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data. The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The relationship will be characterized using the following classification: Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Subject did not receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the IP is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the IP. Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the IP is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause. Note: The Sponsor may query the relationship assessments and/or determine that the event was related to another cause. 10.4. 4. Assessment of Intensity/Severity · AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently. 'Severity' characterizes the intensity of an AE. 'Serious' is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above). · The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reporting during the study and assign a Grade of 1 or 5 in accordance with Assessment of Severity (National Cancer Institute (NCI)- CTCAE (latest version).

The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether it caused the subject to discontinue the study. 10.6. Reporting Serious Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor, regardless of their relationship to the IP or clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported promptly by the Investigator to the Sponsor. Reporting of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory/diagnostic reports) related to the event. The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the source documents. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded electronically in the SAE report form within the electronic data capture system (EDC). The Investigator must complete the SAE form, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE form with the corresponding source documents, sign and date the SAE form and submit it to Safety within 24 hours of it becoming available. All applicable sections of the form must be completed to provide a clinically complete report. The Investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment (OCU200, Administration procedure, other study procedures). Upon completion of the electronic form, Ocugen or designee will be notified electronically by the EDC system. If an SAE occurs and the EDC system cannot be accessed, the information should be entered into a paper SAE form and sent via email to Ocugen or designee within 24 h of awareness of the event. Once access to the EDC system is restored, the information reported on the paper form will be entered into the electronic form within 24 h of the system becoming available. Information on the progression of the initial SAE must be reported as a follow-up to the event irrespective of when it occurs. The follow-up information and supporting documentation should be entered into the EDC system within 24 h or receipt of the follow up information. If the EDC system is unavailable, follow-up information should be reported using the paper form process with subsequent entry into the EDC within 24 h of the system becoming available. All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the time of informed consent until the end of the study. All SAEs must be reported to Ocugen or designee within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours. OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 81",

Sample size The sample size was estimated based on a minimum number necessary to obtain a preliminary clinical assessment regarding OCU200's safety profile within this dosage range following a 3+3 design structure. 12.2. Analysis Populations Analysis of populations will be defined as follows: Intent-to-treat population: All subjects assigned to a cohort. Safety population: All subjects assigned to a cohort who received OCU200. Per-protocol population: All subjects assigned to a cohort who received OCU200 and who did not have a major protocol deviation deemed to have an impact on the primary object of this study. The full list of major protocol deviations will be reviewed for exclusion from this population and decisions made prior to database lock. 12.3. General Considerations A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) containing a full detailed description of data handling, analysis methods, and outputs (tables, figures and listings) will be developed and approved prior to database lock. Additional analysis may be performed if deemed necessary. Any deviations from the SAP will be described and justified in a separate document and in the Clinical Study Report. 12.3.1. Subject Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Subject disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by cohort. 12.3.2. Primary Safety Endpoints Adverse events and specific types will be described using descriptive methods, including counts, frequencies, percentages, by covariates of dosage level, MedDRA classifications, and relationship to study procedures. Study Drug-related adverse events (SDAEs) are considered the primary adverse event of interest and defined as AEs and SAEs that are determined to be related to the Study Drug. AEs will be defined as Ocular or Non-ocular for presentation. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as an event that was not present prior to administration of the dose of study drug and present after the dose, or if it represents the exacerbation of an event that was present prior to the dose. TEAEs are determined by the OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 81",

The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks and drug accountability records. During the study, a monitor from Ocugen and/or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: · Provide information and support to the investigator(s). · Confirm that facilities remain acceptable. · Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed. · Perform source data verification (SDV). It is the study monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout the study to protect the rights of the subjects; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study conduct to any local regulations. SDV includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the subject's medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the eCRFs are complete and accurate. · Record and report any protocol deviations. · Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Ocugen or designee and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. The frequency of monitoring visits will be as described in the Clinical Monitoring Plan but may be modified by the rate of subject recruitment. 13.2. Audits and Inspections Authorized representatives of Ocugen or designee, a regulatory authority, or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact Ocugen immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 of 81",

Informed Consent Process Subject will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meet the requirements of CFR50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC of the study center. A sample ICF containing the required elements of informed consent will be provided by the Sponsor. The actual ICF used at each center may differ, depending on local regulations and IRB/IEC requirements. However, all versions must contain the standard information found in the sample ICF provided by the Sponsor. Any changes made to these samples must be reviewed by the CRO/Sponsor prior to submission to the IRB. After review by the Sponsor, the informed consent form must be submitted to and approved by the IRB/IEC. If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the study, this will be communicated to him/her in a timely manner. Such information will be provided via a revised ICF or an addendum to the original ICF. The Informed consent process will be as follows: · The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all questions regarding the study. No subject should be obliged to participate in the study. · The subject must be informed that participation is voluntary. The information must make clear that refusal to participate in the study or withdrawal from the study at any stage is without any prejudice to the subject's subsequent care. · The subject must be allowed ample time to decide whether they wish to participate. · The subject must be made aware of and give consent to direct access to his/her source medical records by study monitors, auditors, the IRB/IEC, and regulatory authorities. The subject should be informed that such access will not violate subject confidentiality or any applicable regulations. The subject should also be informed that he/she is authorizing such access by signing the ICF. · The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. · Subjects must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. · A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the subject. · The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the subject fully understands the nature and purpose of the study. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible.

Source Documents The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and the distribution of the IP are complete, accurate, filed and retained. Source documents are original documents or certified copies. Examples of source documents include clinic and office charts; medical and hospital records; subject's diaries or evaluation checklists; laboratory notes; memoranda; study logs; informed consent; dispensing records; recorded data from automated instrument; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiche, X-ray firm and reports; records kept at the pharmacy, and the laboratories as well as copy of CRF or CD-ROM. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Data entered in the eCRFs that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Source documents are filed at the Investigator's site. 15.2. Data Management This study will use electronic data system to collect data directly from the investigational site using eCRFs. This data will be electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team. Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data. Data entered in the eCRFs that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between the eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. AEs will be coded with the most current available version of MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO - Drug Reference List. 15.3. Inspection of Records Ocugen or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. If the site utilizes electronic medical records, the Investigator will ensure that all study monitors, Ocugen or designee, will have OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 of 81",

The Investigator must maintain Essential documents for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator must retain these documents for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer. Essential documents include, but are not limited to, the following: · Signed ICFs for all subjects · Subject screening log (if applicable) and enrollment log · Record of all communications between the Investigator and the IRB/IEC · Composition of the IRB/IEC · Record of all communications between the Investigator, Ocugen, and their authorized representative(s) · List of Sub-Investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the Investigator has delegated study-related duties, together with their roles in the study and their signatures; study-specific training records and curriculum vitae · IP accountability records · All other source documents (subject records, hospital records, laboratory records, etc.) · All other documents as listed in Section 8 of the ICH consolidated guideline on GCP (Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records for specified period, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. If the Investigator is unable to meet this obligation, the Investigator must ask Ocugen for permission to make alternative arrangements. Details of these arrangements should be documented. The Investigator must obtain approval in writing from Ocugen prior to destruction of any records. If it becomes necessary for Ocugen or the appropriate Regulatory Authority to review any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator/institution must permit access to such records.
