Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of heterogenous inherited diseases (RP OMIM 268000)1 that result in severe loss of night, peripheral, and central vision with progression to blindness.1 The first sign of RP is usually a loss of night vision, which can become apparent in childhood. The prevalence of RP is 1:4000 individuals and is estimated to affect up to 100,000 people in the US and 1.5 million individuals worldwide.2 Despite advances in identification of primary disease-causing mutations, the genetic cause of approximately 50 % of RP remains unknown.3 RP has multiple modes of inheritance including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked and can arise in both syndromic and non-syndromic forms.3-9 Over 200 mutations in over 150 unique genes are associated with RP accounting for only approximately 50% of all RP cases. 10-19 Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a group of inherited early-onset retinal dystrophies that result in severe visual impairment or blindness and affects approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals in Europe and North America 20. It accounts for around 5% of all inherited retinopathies and approximately 20% of children attending schools for the blind around the world 21. LCA is the most common genetic cause of congenital visual impairment in infants and young children 22. Mutations in at least 25 genes are associated with LCA 23 and account for 80- 90% of all cases 24. CEP290 (OMIM 610142) is the most frequently mutated gene (153 causal mutations) accounting for up to 30% of LCA cases (LCA10) 25,26. This gene encodes a centrosomal protein of 290 kDa 27 which is expressed in the connecting cilium of cone and rod photoreceptors 20 and has a crucial role in regulating protein transportation between outer and inner segments of photoreceptors 20,28. 4.1.1. Clinical Needs Currently, the only FDA approved treatment for IRDs is Luxturna® (Spark Therapeutics), which is indicated for the treatment of biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, for which the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluated safety in subjects 8 years and older (NCT00516477). One report states that 2% of RP cases are associated with mutations in RPE65.29 Therefore, there is no effective FDA approved treatment for the vast majority of adult and pediatric patients with RP. About 3-16% of LCA cases are associated with RPE65 mutations 30 and there is no effective FDA approved treatment for adult and pediatric LCA patients with other mutations. Therapeutic Rationale 4.1.2. Retinitis Pigmentosa 4.1.2.1.

Not all genes and disease expressions are amenable to gene therapy, and for the 50% of patients whose genetic mutations remain unknown, there are no therapeutic options. Currently, all gene therapy clinical trials for RP are Gene Replacement Therapy, none of which will treat the major subject population with unknown and unidentifiable molecular etiology. Ocugen, Inc., has developed the Gene Modifier Therapy with OCU400 to ameliorate multiple forms of RP without requiring knowledge of the mutated gene. The nuclear receptor NR2E3 has demonstrated a crucial role in regulating multiple transcriptional networks that modulate retinal cell homeostasis such as survival, metabolism, inflammation, and phototransduction that impact RP disease.31-34 These data indicate that NR2E3 functions as a modifier gene with therapeutic potential for RP with a wide range of genetic etiology. In pre-clinical studies, Nr2e3-associated retinal disease shows variation in phenotypes that are likely modulated by modifier genes. 18,33-41 Mouse studies demonstrate that the retinal degenerative phenotype associated with mutations in RP genes Nr2e3, rhodopsin, and Rp1 are significantly altered with genetic background.18,38,39,42-50 Mutations in the mouse NR2E3 (the retinal degeneration 7, rd7) represent these various clinical phenotypes.38 These observed phenotypic variations have shown that NR2E3 is a master regulator of photoreceptor cell development, maintenance, and function and modulates RP associated genes and networks,31,51-",

As each disease model has a unique transcriptome signature, the modulation will correlate uniquely. Furthermore, NR2E3 treatment does not have a detrimental effect on the retina. Preliminary studies on toxicity of NR2E3 via administration in P0 wildtype C57BL6/J retinas mice that received subretinal injection of AAV- NR2E3 do not show a detrimental effect on the retina function, and mice behave normally without health issues. 4.1.2.2. Leber Congenital Amaurosis Despite severe visual impairment, recent studies suggested that patients with CEP290-related LCA (LCA10) may be candidates for gene therapy as cone nuclei in the foveal region were structurally detectable 57-59. However, the large size of CEP290 gene impedes the use of adeno- associated virus (AAV) vector for delivery of the genetic material and warrants alternative approaches. Ocugen's preclinical data in a well-accepted animal model of LCA has shown improvement of photoreceptor survival, preservation of retinal structures, and significant increase in cone and rod opsin gene expression after treatment with OCU400 60. Importantly, treatment improved visual function in mice as evaluated by ERG. Subretinal AAV delivery of NR2E3 in the rd16 mice (CEP290 mutations-associated LCA model) rescued retinal degeneration after disease onset. The rd16 mice were injected at P21 and evaluated at 2-3 months post-treatment using fundus imaging, histology, and immunostaining of retinal layers (Figure 2) Improvements were observed in the fundus images of rd16 mice treated with NR2E3 (Figure 2A). Hematoxylin/eosin (H/E) staining revealed that subretinal delivery of NR2E3 at P21 rescued photoreceptor cells and maintained retinal integrity at 2-3 months post-injection in rd16 mice (Figure 2B). The rd16 mice showed an increase of 3 to 6 layers of ONL in NR2E3-treated retinas compared to 0 to 1 layer in the untreated eyes (Figure 2C). The ONL thickness and extent of retina rescued was approximately 30% in all treated retinas. Furthermore, eyes from treated and untreated animals were collected at 2-3 months post-injection and labeled with green and blue cone opsin and rod rhodopsin antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis. Untreated eyes showed no opsin- or rhodopsin-positive photoreceptor cells, whereas NR2E3-treated retinas showed restoration of green and blue opsins and rhodopsin proteins (Figure 2D).

Previous Study Findings 4.2.1. Nonclinical 4.2.1.1. Detailed data are described in the IB (Section 1 and 2). In summary, our pre-clinical studies demonstrated a crucial role for the nuclear receptor NR2E3 regulating multiple transcriptional networks, which modulate cellular homeostasis in the retina. Delivery of NR2E3 in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration and LCA10 attenuates disease progression and rescues the phenotype. 4.2.1.2. Clinical OCU400 has not been previously administered to human subjects and clinical data are not available. The Phase 1 trial described herein represents the first-in-human (FIH) administration of OCU400. Investigators must use the safety data obtained in the nonclinical evaluation of OCU400 as the basis for informing the risk/benefit balance when selecting patients for study participation. The Investigator Brochure (IB) should be read and understood in its entirety, inclusive of the Guidance for the Investigator section of the IB. Clinical Rationale 4.2.2. Rationale for Study Design 4.2.2.1. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of ascending dose levels of OCU400 in a stepwise, sequential manner in a small number of subjects. Ongoing evaluation of emergent safety data will be conducted by DSMB. The design includes discrete study periods that allow subjects' screening, enrollment, treatment, and measurements of outcomes.

Multiple factors are incorporated into the study design to safeguard and monitor the rights and safety of subjects and are described herein. To maximize participant protection, the study will be conducted by Investigators at clinical sites with expertise in inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) and advanced therapies such as gene therapy. All sites will be carefully evaluated and pre-qualified prior to study participation. Sites will have experience in first-in-human studies with gene therapy and appropriate training and equipment on site for emergency management, if required. All sites will be trained on the protocol and all study procedures, including surgical procedure for dose administration to ensure compliance and the protection of subject safety and rights. All investigative sites have experience in subretinal injections for administration of gene therapy and the procedure will be standardized across centers. The number of participants included in the trial minimizes the number of participants exposures while providing a sufficient dataset to allow a preliminary clinical assessment regarding OCU400's safety profile within this dosage range evaluated. OCU400 will be administered in one eye (study eye) of each subject. Administration of escalating doses of OCU400 is completed via discrete cohorts with a sentinel subject in each cohort. A minimum of 6 weeks will elapse between dosing of cohorts to allow for peak expression of the transgene, immune response and for review of the emergent safety data. The DSMB will conduct ongoing review of emergent safety data from the study and make recommendations on study progression. Criteria are established for dose adjustments and for cohort and study stopping. Adjustments to target doses and the number of subjects per cohort may be recommended based on review of the data. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are selected for a participant population with a diagnosis confirmed at the molecular level by genetic testing. To minimize the possibility of false positives for molecular confirmation, only genetic testing from specified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), or equivalent, certified laboratories will be used. The subject selection criteria minimize potentially confounding safety factors such as co- morbidities. The assessments and measurements in the trial assess both general systemic safety and ocular safety. Baseline is established for subjects and intensive monitoring of subject safety in the days and weeks following dose administration is incorporated. Intermediate and long-term monitoring is incorporated in the first-year post-dose Treatment Observation Period and in an extension study up to 5 years post-dose to detect therapy-related delayed adverse events. Rationale for Dose, and Duration of Treatment 4.2.3. OCU400 has been evaluated in a nonclinical program to demonstrate proof of concept (POC), safety and immunogenicity in multiple mouse models of RP and LCA. The results support the further evaluation of OCU400 in humans.",

Under the vitrectomy setting and well-controlled injection speed, these volume ranges are proven to be safe. The choice of volume is dependent on the target treatment regions of retina. The XIRIUS study and TIGER Study both aim to treat the central retina with an injection volume range from 100-200 uL while Luxturna aims to treat pericentral retina. It was trialed and later approved to be used with a 300 uL injection volume. Based on the natural history studies for NR2E3 mutation patients, conducted in collaboration between Ocugen, Inc., and the University of Pennsylvania, the data show that the pericentral area in NR2E3-related RP is highly vulnerable to disease progression that leads to significant functional loss in multiple clinical examinations; therefore, pericentral retina is the region of choice for treatment.65 This is the same target region as Luxturna; therefore, 300 uL volume was chosen for OCU400 subretinal injection. As in the surgical settings, the injection volume may vary at the surgeon's discretion, considering safety and beneficiary treatment coverage. The surgeon must take priority for the protection of the fovea and the aimed treatment area according to pre-operative imaging studies; therefore, the locations and numbers of retinotomy, and the total volume may vary. However, a minimum volume of 200 uL per eye is required. Multiple injection sites are allowed to deliver the desired volume. Since only single dose of OCU400 will be administered during the study, no treatment discontinuation is expected.",

To assess the long-term safety of OCU400, subjects will be followed in Long Term Safety Follow Up (LTSFU) study for additional 2 years (end of year 2, end of year 3) post OCU400 dosing visit. Risks and Benefits OCU400 Risks 4.3. The results of toxicology studies and efficacy in multiple relevant animal models strongly support OCU400 as a potential treatment option for RP in humans. The study described herein is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OCU400 at multiple target doses. Since OCU400 has not been previously administered to humans, unidentified risk may not be known at this time. More detailed information about known and expected risks and reasonably expected adverse events of procedures may be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB), which is the single reference safety documents for this study. It is important the Investigator thoroughly read and understand the IB for OCU400 and use the data presented in the IB as the basis for risk assessment in subjects. If additional safety information becomes available during the trial, it will be provided to Investigators and subjects. Subretinal Injection Risks Risks associated with subretinal injection include pain, cataract formation, endophthalmitis, corneal changes, intraocular hemorrhage (subretinal, vitreoretinal and suprachoroidal), increased IOP, intraocular inflammation, retinal breaks, retinal detachments, hypotony, scleritis, uveitis or sympathetic uveitis and decrease or loss of vision.66,67 Risks associated with nerve block (sub-tenon, retrobulbar or peribulbar) may include globe perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, optic nerve damage, subconjunctival edema, venous and arterial hemorrhage, decreased visual acuity, and myotoxicity.68 Systemic risks may include subarachnoid injection causing respiratory arrest; seizures, loss of consciousness and respiratory depression or cardiac arrest associated with systemic toxicity; pulmonary edema, reaction to epinephrine; oculocardiac reflex and vasovagal reaction; and allergic reactions. 68 Risks associated with general anesthesia may include nausea, vomiting, chills, short-term confusion, and sore throat from breathing tube insertion.69 Rare and serious risks may include postoperative cognitive dysfunction with long-term memory and learning problems; malignant hyperthermia; and breathing problems during and after surgery.69 Other Procedural Risks Venipuncture to obtain blood samples may result in bruising, inflammation, and pain.

These precautions may include use of personal protective equipment such as face coverings, masks, and shields, and procedures such as temperature screening and social distancing and will be consistent with the policies of the institution and compliant with government guidelines. · The site visit schedule has been carefully reviewed to minimize unnecessary visits and minimize subject exposure. The schedule is not expected to increase subject risk beyond that encountered in the routine delivery of healthcare for subjects with chronic eye disease. · The Sponsor will continue to assess risk during the clinical study. This risk assessment will include overall study risk as well as regional risks to allow for adaptations that may be required at a local level depending on COVID-19 infection rates across US regions and cities. Risk mitigation measures, where applicable, will be amended based on emerging government guidelines. Benefits This study is designed to evaluate the safety of ascending doses of OCU400 in subjects with retinitis pigmentosa associated with NR2E3 and RHO mutations and in patients with Leber Congenital Amaurosis associated with CEP290 mutations. Exploratory endpoints may provide preliminary information on the efficacy of treatment with OCU400; however, subjects may receive no benefit from participation in this study. Subjects may experience improvements in dim light vision and may experience improvements in their visual acuity. Any such improvement may be transitory. Subjects may experience an altruistic sense of satisfaction by participating in this study knowing that information learned from this study may benefit others and aid in the advancement of therapeutic options for future subjects.

Treatment Assignment 6.3. This is an open-label study, and all subjects will receive OCU400 at the target or adjusted dose level assigned to their respective Cohort and Phase. Dose Adjustment Criteria 6.4. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses 6.4.1. This protocol allows for adjustment of targeted doses based upon emergent data from ongoing DSMB safety reviews. Common expected AE and SAE are known complications of surgery, anesthesia, and corticosteroids. Details of AE and SAE are described in IB Section 7. The expected AEs include conjunctival hyperemia, cataract, increased intraocular pressure, dellen (thinning of the corneal stroma), retinal tear, eye inflammation, macular hole, retinal deposit, eye irritation, eye pain, and maculopathy; as well as SAE including endophthalmitis, foveal thinning and loss of foveal function, fovea dehiscence (separation of the retinal layers in the center of the macula), retinal hemorrhage. These AE and SAE are frequently related to vitrectomy and subretinal injection. Other systemic AE including hematuria, vomiting, nausea, pyrexia, and headache; systemic SAE include anal fistula, paresthesia, convulsion, hyper- or hypoglycemia, leukocytosis and adverse drug reactions are related to anesthesia and use of corticosteroids. Dose-limiting side effects are defined as OCU400-related AEs that are considered severe in nature, intolerable, or that, in the opinion of the Investigator, Sponsor, or DSMB would place subjects at medical risk if a higher dose of OCU400 were to be administered. These AEs would be consistent with Grade 3 and higher severity according to the Common Terminology Criteria OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 124",

A participant is free to withdraw the informed consent from the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. 2. Withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted. All assessments outlined for early withdraw visit should be completed. In the event that a subject elects not to return to the clinic for the scheduled visit, the Investigator must make every effort to contact the subject to review all AEs. If a subject has an adverse event, the subject will be followed until the adverse event has either resolved or satisfactorily stabilized in the judgment of the Investigator. When a participant withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported on the clinical trial SAE Report.

Vital Signs All vital sign measurements will be taken after a subject has been in a sitting position for a minimum of 5 minutes. Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and body temperature. Radial or brachial pulse will be measured over a 30 second interval, if performed manually and respiration rate will be measured over a 60 second interval. Body temperature may be oral or aural. Blood pressure should be obtained from the same arm throughout the study whenever possible. An electronic or manual sphygmomanometer or an electronic oscillometric device may be used. The method of assessment should be consistent throughout the study. Weight and Height 9.1.3. Height and weight will be measured in full indoor clothing without shoes at the Screening visit. A body-mass index will be calculated using the screening height and weight values. 9.1.4. Physical Examination General wellness of the subject. Report any acute distress, pain, or discomfort with focused system examination if the subject is symptomatic. The investigator determines if an emergency referral or referral to a specialist is needed. A full physical examination is required at the screening of subjects, including skin, ENT, head, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and extremities. Molecular Confirmation of Diagnoses 9.1.5. To be enrolled in this study, a confirmed molecular diagnosis for the autosomal recessive and dominant NR2E3 mutations RHO or CEP290 mutations is required. Testing results will be reviewed, and eligibility confirmed by the Investigator during enrollment. Historical molecular confirmation for subjects who may have previously undergone genetic testing may be acceptable if the testing was completed by a CLIA, or equivalent, certified clinical laboratory. 9.1.6. Laboratory Assessments A listing of laboratory tests utilized during the screening period to qualify subjects for study participation and throughout the study to monitor subject safety is provided in Table 7. All laboratory testing will be conducted in the fasting state and a CLIA certified central laboratory will be used for all analyses. Blood and urine samples are to be obtained and processed according to instructions provided in the Study Reference Manual. Investigators will review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and assess all values outside the reference ranges for clinical significance. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor.

When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record \"anemia\" rather than \"low hemoglobin\"). · AEs will be assessed during the study as described in the SoE and should be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and reported to the sponsor, regardless of their relationship to study drug or clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. · All AEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or within 5 years following the cessation of treatment, whether they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by Ocugen or designee. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 9.2.1.2. An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria: · Fatal: AE resulted in death · Life-threatening: The AEs placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This classification does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe. · Hospitalization: The AE resulted in hospitalization or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization. In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during the hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalization\" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. · Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before the signing of informed consent in the study or routine check-ups are not SAEs by this criterion. Admission to a palliative unit facility is not considered to be a hospitalization. · Disabling/incapacitating: An AE that resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the subject's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

The order of ocular efficacy and exploratory assessments and their relationship to timing of ocular safety assessments is specified in the Study Reference Manual. 10.1.1. Visual Acuity: RP and LCA Visual acuity tests are described in Section 9.1.9 and the Study Reference Manual, regarding instructions for visual acuity measurement. Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT): RP and LCA 10.1.2. Subjects will navigate a standardized mobility maze under set conditions as specified times during the study. The mobility testing will follow a standardized administration and data acquisition protocol and may only be administered by site staff certified in the methodology. 10.1.3. Luminance Dependent Navigation Assessment (LDNA) Participants will navigate a standardized mobility maze under set conditions as specified times during the study. The mobility testing will follow a standardized administration and data acquisition protocol and may only be administered by site staff certified in the methodology. LDNA is a term we adopted to characterize the Multi-Luminance Mobility Test used in the Phase 1/2 Study. Participant testing consists of walking through several configurations each at a different illumination level as a test of visual function. Each test is videotaped and scored for speed and accuracy (number of errors) by independent trained graders and a Lux level score is assigned as per test method data analyses plan. The change to LDNA reflects an enhanced and more sensitive evaluation, where study participants are appraised based on their navigational abilities within a standardized maze featuring variable luminance threshold levels. The LDNA will be performed optionally for subjects who have completed the long-term safety follow-up at the end of years 2 and 3. However, it will be a required assessment for subjects receiving OCU400 in their second eye. In order to complete the assessment the subjects are required to travel in to the following LDNA sponsor locations located in Arizona, Miami, Texas, Philadelphia and Sandiego in specified time points during the study. Please refer to the schedule of assessment Table 3 and Table 5. The LDNA will be conducted using the following 10 lux levels: 0.04, 0.12, 0.35, 1, 3, 8, 22, 63, 178, and 500lux. More details about the methods and the scoring for LDNA can be found in the LDNA Manual of Procedures. Efficacy for this endpoint is evaluated by comparing the difference between the LDNA Lux Level at the study endpoints when compared to the baseline as described in the manual of procedures.

SDV includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the subject's medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the CRF are complete and accurate. · Record and report any protocol deviations. · Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Ocugen or designee and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. The frequency of monitoring visits will be as described in the Monitoring Plan but may be modified by the rate of patient recruitment. Audits and Inspections 12.2. Authorized representatives of Ocugen or designee, a regulatory authority, or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact Ocugen immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. 12.3. Protocol Adherence and Amendments The study protocol defines the objectives, procedures and data to be collected from subjects. Investigators are not allowed to collect additional data or conduct additional procedures unless deemed necessary to ensure the safety of a subject. Investigators will adhere to the protocol and deviations will be reported and recorded. No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by the Investigator or the Sponsor after the protocol has been agreed to and signed by all parties unless such change(s) or amendment(s) has (have) been agreed upon by the Investigator or the Sponsor. Any change agreed upon will be recorded in writing, and the written amendment will be signed by the Investigator and the Sponsor. IRB approval is required prior to the implementation of an amendment, unless overriding safety reasons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB/IEC will be promptly notified. Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, potential benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study objectives, study design, participant population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be released by the Sponsor, agreed by the Investigator(s), and approved by the relevant IRB/IEC prior to implementation. OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 72 of 124",

The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and the distribution of the IP are complete, accurate, filed and retained. Source documents are original documents or certified copies. Examples of source documents include clinic and office charts; medical and hospital records; subject's diaries or evaluation checklists; laboratory notes; memoranda; study logs; informed consent; dispensing records; recorded data from automated instrument; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiche, x-ray firm and reports; records kept at the pharmacy, and the laboratories as well as copy of CRF or CD-ROM. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Source documents are filed at the Investigator's site. 14.2. Data Management This study will use electronic data system to collect data directly from the investigational site using eCRFs. This data will be electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team. Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between the eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the Monitoring Plan. AEs will be coded with the most current available version of MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO - Drug Reference List. Inspection of Records 14.3. Ocugen or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and OCUGEN Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL Page 78 of 124",

          "Participants will navigate a standardized mobility maze under set conditions as specified times during the study. The mobility testing will follow a standardized administration and data acquisition protocol and may only be administered by site staff certified in the methodology. LDNA is a term we adopted to characterize the Multi-Luminance Mobility Test used in the Phase 1/2 Study. Participant testing consists of walking through several configurations each at a different illumination level as a test of visual function. Each test is videotaped and scored for speed and accuracy (number of errors) by independent trained graders and a Lux level score is assigned as per test method data analyses plan. The change to LDNA reflects an enhanced and more sensitive evaluation, where study participants are appraised based on their navigational abilities within a standardized maze featuring variable luminance threshold levels. The LDNA will be performed optionally for subjects who have completed the long-term safety follow-up at the end of years 2 and 3. However, it will be a required assessment for subjects receiving OCU400 in their second eye. In order to complete the assessment the subjects are required to travel in to the following LDNA sponsor locations located in Arizona, Miami, Texas, Philadelphia and Sandiego in specified time points during the study. Please refer to the schedule of assessment Table 3 and Table 5. The LDNA will be conducted using the following 10 lux levels: 0.04, 0.12, 0.35, 1, 3, 8, 22, 63, 178, and 500lux.
