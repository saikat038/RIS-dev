For the combination therapy cohort, a total of 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled to receive OCU200 (MTD) + Lucentis. A total of up to 30 subjects will be included in this study. · Added rationale for adding OCU200 Cohort 4: To further refine the therapeutic window and explore potential improvements in efficacy while preserving an acceptable safety profile, a new intermediate dose level of 0.25 mg/eye (5 mg/mL) is proposed for evaluation as Cohort 4. This dose level is informed by nonclinical toxicology data from non-human primate (NHP) studies, in which the highest tested and well-tolerated dose was 0.5 mg/eye. This is half of the maximum tolerable dose tested in NHP. No ocular toxicity was observed at 0.5 mg/eye (10 mg/mL) except for minimal microscopic observations in NHP study and therefore 0.5 mg/eye (10mg/mL) is considered no observed adverse event level (NOAEL) for ocular tissues. The proposed dose (0.25 mg/eye) in cohort 4 will have 2X safety margin based on NOAEL. Inclusion of the 0.25 mg/eye dose in the clinical trial design will enable a more detailed characterization of the dose-response relationship, supporting identification of an optimal dose that balances safety with therapeutic effect before proceeding to the maximum tolerated dose.",
